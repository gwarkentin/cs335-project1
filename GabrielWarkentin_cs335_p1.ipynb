    "\n",
    "Cities in lie in a circlular directed graph, each city has limited fuel to give, distances between differ. There are no branches.\n",
    "Pick the 1 starting city which allows you to travel through all cities back to the start traveling clockwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with 0 gallons + the fuel of the first city\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sample Input:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "city_distances = [ 5, 25, 15, 10, 15]\n",
    "fuel =           [ 1,  2,  1,  0,  3]\n",

    "First thing is to determine what the net fuel per stop would be. It is most straightforward to build that into an array to analyze.\n",
